# FullStackProjects

1 - Sociopedia 
This is where i learnt good coding practices and learnt how to make an appealing social media platform. I focused alot on this project in making the site look good, thus helping my UI/UX Skills. I used the MERN Stack and took friends suggestions to help improve the layout of the app, this helped me make an app that was focused more on User Experience. 


2 - Next.js 13 https://full-stack-projects-chi.vercel.app/

I used this app to learn how to communicate with external APIs to retrieve data and present it in a meaningful way. I built the app using the latest version of the Next.js framework, Next.js 13, which helped me understand the advantages of using Next.js. The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed using the link above. Additionally, the app includes a caching feature to store results, which helps reduce storage and bandwidth usage.

3- Airbnb inspired Booking App

I worked on another project using the MERN Stack where I created a clone of Airbnb. This project allowed me to refine the skills I had previously learned and deepen my understanding of web development fundamentals. It particularly taught me how to effectively debug and troubleshoot code, as well as the importance of componentizing blocks of code to improve code organization and maintainability. By writing code that performs specific purposes, I was able to reduce bugs and enhance my overall Developer Experience (DX) and coding proficiency.
